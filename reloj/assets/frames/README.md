# Watch Frame Artwork

Place 1024x1024 (or larger) transparent PNG images in this folder to skin the outer bezel of the chronograph.

Current configuration expects a single file named `audemars_piguet.png`. Center the bezel artwork and leave the interior transparent so the clock dial remains visible. The application scales the image to fit the widget, so square art with generous transparency around the bezel produces the best results.
